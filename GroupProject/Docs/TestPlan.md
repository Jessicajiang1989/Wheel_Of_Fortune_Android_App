# Test Plan

**Author** : mmills40 and ylan35

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

unit- testing each developer will complete unit testing for their assigned classes integration- integration testing between classes will be performed with joint ownership of the class owners involved system- testing will be performed by testing owner - mmills40

### 1.2 Test Selection

Blackbox testing will be conducted based on the individual user requirements. This will be done primarily at the system and integration level. Whitebox testing will be added after coding has begun since white box testing requires testing with a knowledge of how the code is written. Whitebox testing will be done primarily at the unit test level.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

We ensure, at a minimum, that for every user requirement there is at least one test case to prove that the assertion in that requirement is true. For example, that users should not have the option to play their own puzzles. This will be verified by a human interacting with an emulation of the app to verify all expected outcomes.

Additionally, we will practice test driven development. To develop individual unit tests for our classes as we build the application.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

We will track individual bugs via the test cases grid below. Bugs and Enhancements will be prioritized against each other, with 0 representing the most important item to be done first, and the highest number representing the least important/impactful item which will be done last. Prioritization will be done against the available developer time for the project. Due to this constraint, it is possible that not all enhancements or bugs will be resolved by launch. Justification will be provided for items left out of initial launch(project delivery).

### 1.5 Technology

Android emulator will be used to test the app in lieu of physically installing on a device.
